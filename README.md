					Android-based Guitar Trainer

The GuitarTrainer is suggested train you basic skills required to play a guitar. Additionally to existing similar apps it should be able to recognize what you are playing directly. In such way not only mental but also motoric skills are trained.

The lessons are organized in such way, that the user is confronted with a question.
Example of a simple lesson:
  Play note C in III octave.
As answer you are suggested to play the note on the fretboard of the real guitar.

The basic ideas, some of them make the app different from existing ones which I saw already:
* reliable FFT-based algorithm for pitch recognition
* using the learning algorithm, like SM2
* maybe, development of the cheap MIDI-guitar prototype
* develop the learning scheme (lessons) so that the learner doesnot loose the motivation and makes a progress

The project is not intended to be commercial. The exception is possible, if the MIDI-guitar is developed and sold. But the profit is not the aim of the project.

Basically, the GuitarTrainer can also be extended to the other music instruments. But it has of cause its limits. As much as the keaboard trainer can help you to become a writer, as much the guitar trainer can help you to become a musician.

The projects listed have motivated the GuitarTrainer and give confidence, that it is possible and probably useful:
* "gString":https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings&hl=de - FFT-based pitch recognition is possible
* "Anki":http://ankisrs.net/ - the learning algorithms are used and usefull
* "Guitar Scales Methods":http://www.guitarscalesmethod.com/ - it is something, which can be learned about guitar without a teacher (fretboard layout)
* not mentioned here, but there are apporaches to implement a MIDI-guitar
